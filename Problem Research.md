# Problem Research

## Problem Brief
As people increasingly rely on technological devices for both work and play, many have neglected to take breaks from looking at their screens, which may result in various health consequences including poorer eyesight, headaches, sleep deprivation and other chronic health risks from the long-term lack of physical activity.

## Backstory
Our team members have noticed that many of our peers spend large parts of their day on various technological devices whether it be for work (e.g. coding on a laptop) or leisure (e.g. playing mobile games). The problem is exacerbated whenever assignment deadlines draw near; many of our peers (ourselves included at times) are not motivated to take breaks because 1. there is just so much to do on our devices, and 2. it is hard to find a time to stop what we are doing to rest.

### Existing Solutions
Many browser extensions allow the creation of timers and reminders based on concepts such as the Pomodoro method for taking breaks, *but* these are easily skippable and offers no extrinsic motivation for the user to actually take breaks, meaning that they have no reason to follow the timer unless they themselves want to.
